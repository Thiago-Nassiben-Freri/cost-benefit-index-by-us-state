## About
This is a simple data analysis project using Python and its libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy. Basically, I used data from various sources to abstract it into a statistical index, which I called "Cost-Benefit Index". I used data normalization to obtain the index between 0 and 1.
